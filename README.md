## 🧬 About Me

> "Everything I see is someone’s contribution. I’m just here to leave a small, thoughtful trace of my own."

Hi, I'm **Afnan**, though online I often go by **Anakin** — not because I’ve joined the dark side ⚔️, but because I’m drawn to the tension between power and purpose, logic and emotion, code and creativity.

I'm a **Data Science major** based in **Pakistan**.

### 🧠 I believe:

- Curiosity is a form of courage.
- Learning is never linear — it's layered, messy, and worth it.

### 🔎 What I’m Exploring:

- 🤖 **Robotics** — Making machines sense, decide, and move with intent  
- 📊 **Data Science** — Interpreting signals in noise and finding clarity in patterns  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning** — Modeling cognition to solve real-world problems  
- 🔬 **AI/ML Engineering** — Turning prototypes into production-ready tools  
- 🧩 **Systems Thinking** — Understanding how the parts create the whole
