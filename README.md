## 🧬 About Me

> "We don't just program machines. We teach them to see, think, and act — and in doing so, we reshape ourselves."

Hi, I'm **Afnan**, though online I often go by **Anakin** — not because I’ve joined the dark side ⚔️, but because I’m drawn to the tension between power and purpose, logic and emotion, code and creativity.

I'm a **Data Science major** based in **Pakistan**, walking the long road of learning — with a mind full of questions and a keyboard full of code.

More than anything, I’m obsessed with the **"why"** behind systems:
- Why do machines learn the way they do?
- Why does data tell one story and hide another?
- Why do we trust algorithms to make decisions — and how can we build them more ethically?

My work isn't just about writing programs — it's about **engineering thought**.  
Whether it's a robot that moves or a model that predicts, I care about building things that make sense and make a difference.

### 🧠 I believe:

- Curiosity is a form of courage.
- Learning is never linear — it's layered, messy, and worth it.
- The most powerful technologies begin with **human intent**.
- The future belongs to those who can bridge disciplines, not just master them.

### 🔎 What I’m Exploring:

- 🤖 **Robotics** — Making machines sense, decide, and move with intent  
- 📊 **Data Science** — Interpreting signals in noise and finding clarity in patterns  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning** — Modeling cognition to solve real-world problems  
- 🔬 **AI/ML Engineering** — Turning prototypes into production-ready tools  
- 🧩 **Systems Thinking** — Understanding how the parts create the whole
